## 📌 Overview

> **Note:** This project is **personal** and **proprietary**.  
> It is **not** open for public contribution, reuse, or forking.

**Pathfinder AI** is an experimental AI-driven web platform to create **dedicated, distraction-free learning paths** for any topic.  
It allows you to **structure modular learning content**, embed **quizzes**, integrate **YouTube videos**, and track **progress** — all in one clean interface.

🛠 Currently **paused in development** due to other ongoing projects.  
Expected to resume later with **more features** and **better AI integration**.

## 🚀 Core Idea & Vision

- **Modular Learning Paths** – Break any skill into modules, lessons, and checkpoints.
- **Built-in Quizzes** – Test understanding after each section.
- **Video Integration** – Pull in curated YouTube videos into a separate, focused view.
- **Zero Distractions** – Learners stay in a dedicated space without interference.
- **AI Assistance** – Suggests resources and creates paths automatically (future).
